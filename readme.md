LiteLLM Agent Platform sits on top of any runtime. Pick a runtime, create an
agent, give your team one UI.

It manages:

- **Unified API across runtimes** - one API to create and run agents,
  regardless of the runtime underneath
- **Access** - developers create and run agents here, no Bedrock or Anthropic
  console access required
- **Session management** - persistent agent sessions across runs
- **CRON schedules** - run agents on a schedule
- **Memory** - agents remember context across sessions

## Quick Start

Prerequisite: Docker Desktop.

```bash
docker compose --profile opencode up
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and sign in with the
master key (`sk-local` by default). Compose starts the LiteLLM Agent Platform
web/API service, a Postgres database, the OpenCode template runtime, and
registers `local-opencode` in the UI automatically.

To start only the base LAP stack:

```bash
docker compose up
```

To start other template runtime profiles and add them to the UI automatically:

```bash
docker compose --profile deepagents up
docker compose --profile opencode --profile deepagents up
```

Profiles register `local-opencode` and `local-deepagents` through the LAP API
after the services are healthy. Add provider credentials in Settings before
running agents against a hosted model provider.
